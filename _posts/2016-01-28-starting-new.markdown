### Everyone needs to start somewhere
Hey, my name is Shawn! I am new to this but I am going to give it a go. If not a single person see's this I will be ok with that, but my word will be out there. I have been slacking on my free time development and I plan on getting back into that in a big way. I will be making my own website short and updated projects I have been working on such as my langtons-ant's project, and presentation-push that can be found on my github account or npm.

### About Me
I am currently a 23 year old Science student double majoring in Computers Science and Mathematics. I just moved back to my parents house because in a month I will be in Germany for the next 5 months for school and vacation.

### Where this is going
Well I have no idea, I will probably most likely be talking about my travels, or computer science/math topics or really anything that brings to mind.
