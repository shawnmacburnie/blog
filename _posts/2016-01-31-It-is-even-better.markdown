### Doubt
Angular is a front end javascript MCV framework that a lot of top companies use as it was made by google and it promised scalability and realiability for web projects. When they mentioned their angular 2 release that would not be backwards compatable with with ANY angular v1 code freaked a lot of people out. Persionally I knew that if they were changing all their code base that it would be for a good reason. A lot of the backbone of angular v1 was using outdated ways on doing things on the web. In my opinion if things need to be changed they should be, if they are doing things that are not following the standards or that need huge improvements that they should.

### My Thoughts on beta release
I am a big fan of angular and I do profesional development work in angular (v1 that is) and I consider myself really good and extreamly knowledgeable about it. I starting using the beta release for angular 2 today and I LOVE IT! I do see why a lot of people are not happy with it as it is completely different and it is a lot harder to move from angular v1 to angular v2, but the changes are worth it. Not only are they following standards and they are building support for ES6. They way they have build it and the new structure of all files and objects are way better designed and more understandable for other programmers. It will actually be easier to use for someone who know's javascript but not angular.
